## Why **know-your-stargazers**

When developing an open source project, sometimes you are curious to know who starred your project. `know-your-stargazers` is a simple CLI program that will help you to know who are interested to your project.

## How to use

Just simply run:

```bash
npx know-your-stargazers
```

## GitHub Personal Access Token

`know-your-stargazers` uses [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to crawl your stargazers (i.e: who starred your project). The default GitHub API rate limit is 60 requests per hour. By providing a personal access token, you can [increase the rate limit to 5000 requests per hour](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#requests-from-personal-accounts).

## Environment Variables

`know-your-stargazers` prefills the default values of `owner`, `repo` and `token` by looking for the following environment variables: `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO`. You can set these environment variables in your `.env` file as well.

```bash
// .env
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_something
GITHUB_OWNER=username-or-organization
GITHUB_REPO=repo-name

```
